# ATM Simulator Project Overview

The ATM Simulator project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It aims to provide practical experience in handling financial transactions, implementing data security measures, and understanding object-oriented programming concepts.

## Project Goals:

 + Understanding Transactions and Security: Gain proficiency in managing financial transactions securely.
 +  Working with Interfaces and Polymorphism: Implement flexible and scalable architecture using interfaces and polymorphism.
 +   Mastery of Java Basics: Utilize Java features such as collections, exceptions, multithreading, and file systems.

## Project Description:

The project involves creating a console application that mimics the functionalities of a real ATM. Users can perform various operations such as checking balances, withdrawing and depositing cash, transferring money between accounts, changing PIN codes, and maintaining a transaction log. The application handles different user scenarios and errors efficiently.
